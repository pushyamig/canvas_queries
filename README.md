## Athletic student google sheet roster
Athletic dept provides all the student enrolled to their program in current term via a google sheet. We have an additional step 
in making this data available to Tableau dashboard as table called `student_athletic_export_csv`. We created this table since Tableau
has some issues connecting to google sheets.
Every term this table (student_athletic_export) need to updated with latest data. This table resides in the context store with user account provisioned for the project
Steps to update the table
1. create a CSV File from the current term student roster
2. Open the SQL editor from you SQL client and run `delete from student_athlete_export_csv ` to delete all the rows
3. Right click on the `student_athletic_export_csv` table import CSV (from step 1)
4. Verify it has latest info.
